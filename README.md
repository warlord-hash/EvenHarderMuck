# EvenHarderMuck
Even Harder Muck (or EHM) is a mod that makes Muck even harder in lots of ways.

### Features
Even Harder Muck currently features longer nights, buffed enemies (including bosses), hunger depleting health, no speed cap, no dracula limit and a special Supermoon.

I currently have lots of features planned, like more custom items & ways to make the game even harder, but I decided to release the mod early and see how easy or hard it is for others.

### How to install (manual)
After you've downloaded the mod, open the .zip file & open the folder named "EvenHarderMuck". Export it in ``your_steam_muck_folder\BepInEx\Plugins`` & open up the game.

### How to play on multiplayer
To play on multiplayer with others, all of the players in your lobby must have the mod.
