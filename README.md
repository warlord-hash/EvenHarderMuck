# EvenHarderMuck
Even Harder Muck (or EHM) is a mod that makes Muck even harder in lots of ways.

### Features
Even Harder Muck currently features longer nights, buffed enemies (including bosses), hunger depleting health & no speed cap.

I currently have lots of features planned, like more custom items & ways to make the game even harder, but I decided to release the mod early and see how easy or hard it is for others.

### How to install
After you've downloaded the mod, open the rar file & proceed to the directory named "EvenHarderMuck". Export it in ``your_steam_muck_folder\BepInEx\Plugins`` & open up the game.
